# Summary
This package is for simulating the control of qubits coupled to coherent and dissapative noise using a QAOA-inspired Hamiltonian switching ansatz for the purpose of implementating high fidelity quantum gates. The classical optimization methods are Sequential Convex Programming and Reinforcement learning with Policy Gradient. 

The manuscript of this work is in preparation. This file is being updated.
