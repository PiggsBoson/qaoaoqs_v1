# Error Mitigation with Bipartite Hamiltonian Switching Control
This package is for simulating the control of qubits coupled to coherent and dissapative noise using a Hamiltonian switching ansatz inspired by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).

To setup, 
```
git clone https://github.com/PiggsBoson/qaoaoqs_v1.git
cd qaoaoqs_v1/Environments
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hsctrl
```
